        "# Analysing Mos Def's *Mathematics*\n",
        "\n",
        "Yasiin Bey previously known by his stage name Mos Def is a legendary MC, rapper, political activist and actor. His own work often addresses socio-political issues through the use of masterful lyrics and rhimes. [*Mathematics*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SHa_dgIG7w&ab_channel=UranKabashi), a song from his solo debut album *Black on Both Sides* is a stunning example of this, where he raps about social injustices in the 90's (most still relevant today) through statistics in the US whilst highlighting the dangers and dehumanization of reducing peoples to mere numbers. \n",

        "2.   On which line does Yasiin refer to *A Tribe Called Quest*'s [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru7NDq-TT5M&ab_channel=ATribeCalledQuest-Topic) \"8 million stories\" (apart from referencing Tribe's laid-back style of beats)? Print the line and the line number.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How many lines contained within the song lyrics correspond to meta information?                                                                 Meta information about the song is contained within square brackets. For instance: \"[Outro]\". \n",
